                                A Java based, basic employee management system. Simplistic in nature, this was aimed towards smaller businesses who need a cost-effective solution.
                                We chose this particular project as it utilised the technologies we had to use during second year. Teambuilder, oracle and Java were required.
                                An Employee management system allowed us enough scope to allow for breathing room in reference to functionality and design.
                                All Employee management systems seem to look and function the same, and allow for a wider array of aspects.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Functionality:</h2>
                            <p>
                                Allows users to manage an intranet for a system. Basic CRUD functionality, basic CRUD functionality built on a team builder,
                                allows users to request leave for a standard amount time. A user’s contract can be added and edited from the application.
                                All users can search for other users by employee number, first-name, surname and Department.

                                There are three different levels of User: Standard, Admin and Manager. Admin deals with the whole system management,
                                Managers can build teams and review leave application.

                                This choice of project stemmed from our decision on learning something new.
                                At the time of this project, my project partner and I had only learned C++ and Java.
                                We wanted to actively learn a new language and new methodology while building this project.
                                We thought that Contacto- as an app- would have the specific functionality and complexity to allow for grading,
                                while also being simple enough for a newbie to the language to learn without any problems or incidents that could
                                cause trouble to myself and my project partner. We also wanted to try out other storage options outside a local relational database-
                                hence, we decided on a JSON document as a Database.

                                Contacto was a functional but minimalistic contact app which allowed users to opt for a third party choice rather than the built in windows choice.
                                A key aspect that differentiates Contacto from other phonebook/contact systems was the usage of dynamic fields. Rather than stuck to set fields specified by the system, users could add their own fields to the system- unique, intimate fields. We also added some basic fields for usage- such as email, etc.
                                Our users could also email, text and call through the windows phone’s own library. We opted for this choice over our own so that the system could fit snuggly into the ecosystem- and allows users to specify their own email clients too.
                                The app also featured a backup (via Azure) which allowed users to store their whole set of contacts to our cloud source, then re-download to that exact phone- we used the phone’s own ID to bind to the cloud aspect to avoid needing any sort of login.
